 * for the condition to arrive.  If the timeout is < 0 then the call will
 * wait indefinitely.  If the timeout is 0.0, the call will return immediately.
 * Returns -1 on an error, 1 if the condition is fulfilled and 0 if the
 * condition isn't satisfied.  Aborts on negative file descriptor.  This
 * function ignores an interrupted wait and tries again until successful.  This
 * is fine for some applications, but not for those that may want the signal
 * to abort the wait.
