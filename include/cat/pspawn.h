/* ------------- 
   The steps for setting up I/O for the process are as follows 

   1) specify which file descriptors from the parent to keep but not remap
      (ps_spec_keepfd() for each)

   2) specify which file descriptors from the parent to remap
      (ps_spec_add_remap() for each)
      + for the fde returned from each ps_spec_add_remap() call:
        - for each fd that the child should have this parent fd mapped to:
           * ps_fde_addfd() for that target fd

   3) specify which file descriptors to have as pipes/sockets to/from/both
      the parent
      + ps_spec_add_pipe() for each specifying
        - whether input, output or both
        - whether the server side should use stdio
        - what buffering mode to use if using stdio
      + for each fde returned from ps_spec_add_pipe()
        - for each fd that the child should have this pipe mapped to:
           * ps_fde_addfd() for the target fd

   4) specify which file descriptors to redirect from/to a file system
      object (such as a file)
      + ps_spec_add_fsrdr() for each specifying
        - whether to open for input / output or both
        - whether to open for appending (output-only)
      + for each fde returned from ps_spec_add_fsrdr()
        - for each fd that the child should have this file mapped to:
           * ps_fde_addfd() for the target fd
        - if the mode should be changed call ps_rdr_set_mode()
